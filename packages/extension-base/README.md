Functions, classes and other utilities used in `@axia-js/extension`. These include:
- background script handlers,
- message passing,
- scripts injected inside pages.

They are primarily meant to be used in `@axia-js/extension`, and can be broken without any notice to cater for `@axia-js/extension`'s needs. They are exported here if you wish to use part of them in the development of your own extension.
